    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <h2>Tower of Trials</h2>
    <h4>What</h4>
    There are 4 different towers. The primary one has no restrictions but the other 3 (Wisdom, Agility, Strength) limit you to what type of heroes you can use. Each restriction corresponds with the name of the tower.<br>
    Primary Tower (Every day): 170<br>
    Wisdom Tower (Wed, Sat, Sun): 125<br>
    Agility Tower (Tue, Fri, Sun): 125<br>
    Strength Tower (Mon, Thu, Sun): 125<br>
    <h4>Why</h4>
    Rewards include: pub reset tickets, gold, grassland marble and hero fragments. You will get extra gold, hero fragments and even some gems every 5th floor.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Rift</h2>
    <h4>What</h4>
    There are 3 floors per rift level with the last floor including a boss fight. The floors are timed with the timer resetting each time you reach the next stage of the floor.<br>
    <h4>Why</h4>
    Rewards include crimson rift stone, rift stones, hero symbols and guardian/punisher weapon/armor that can only be found by participating in this challenge. There is also a weekly leaderboard,<br>
    that rewards players with gold, rift reroll tickets and gems that you can use to quickly refresh the stats given by a particular floor.<br>
    <h3>Misc</h3>
    <h4>What is a Rift Enhance Stone?</h4>
    A rift enhance stone allows access to the punisher weapon/armor set. Without the booster activated you are limited to the guardian weapon/armor set which has lower stats.<br>
    It also grants you more rift stones to reroll stats of stages, you've already completed and crimson rift stones for the rift shop.<br>
    <h4>Will I keep my rift progress from week to week?</h4>
    Rift doesn't reset until stage 50 and when you passed that stage it will take the amount of stages that you've completed after 50 and divide it by two and then add them back onto the 50.<br>
    So for example, if you have completed stage 64, you will get reset to stage 57. Or on 67 to 58, because there is no stage 58.5. With this in mind plan accordingly,<br>
    only focus on stats from floors you know you'll retain the following week. You will however keep your crimson rift stone count for the rift shop but at the same time your purple shard count is reset back to 0.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Village Defense</h2>
    <h4>What</h4>
    There are 2 separate modes, normal and infinite, normal includes 30 waves of enemies, with a boss encounter every 5 waves. And infinite introduces increasingly harder waves until you are eventually overwhelmed.<br>
    You will collect the tears, that killed monsters dropped and at the top, when the bar reaches the end, you will always get to choose between three heroes that join the battle.<br>
    You will also get one symbol of a legendary hero, when you have two of the corresponding heroes on the battle field. And it'll upgrade to a legendary symbol, when you get a third hero to join<br>
    <h4>Why</h4>
    In normal mode you will be rewarded with rings that increase in power with higher floors and will benefit your party as a whole. In infinite mode, higher time results in a better gold and gems reward from the weekly leaderboard leaderboard placement.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Pub</h2>
    <h4>What</h4>
    The pub is an area that grants you fragments for a random selection of three heroes. You can accept fragments for the hero that it selects, but you can also reroll for gems and try to get fragments for a one of the two left heroes.<br>
    <h4>Why</h4>
    This is the primary way you'll be gaining fragments for your heroes.
    <h3>Misc</h3>
    <h4>The pub feels rigged</h4>
    It may feel a bit rigged sometimes, but you can always check the chances of pulling a specific hero at the bottom of their corresponding card in the pub. Higher tier heroes have a lower chance of getting pulled than lower tier ones.<br>
    <h4>What are mileage points?</h4>
    Mileage points grant you access to the mileage shop, which has a selection of random things/heroes.<br>
    <h4>Will mileage shop heroes be avialable for puchase after they expire?</h4>
    It hasn't been confirmed either way. That means we could get them back but maybe we don't.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Training Grounds</h2>
    <h4>What</h4>
    Training grounds allow you to purchase stat increases for your party, party expansions, and specialized trainings that offer passive hero fragments over time.<br>
    <h4>Why</h4>
    Your party can hold a maximum of 10 heroes, and you need 10 heroes to participate in most of the end-game content effectively. The special training also allows you to top off heroes that are one or two fragments away from leveling up.<br>
    <h3>Misc</h3>
    <h4>What is a hero fragment?</h4>
    You will gain 1 hero fragment after the allotted time has ended. Up to a maxium of three until the hero pauses and waits for you to claim the frgaments.
    <h4>What are the required fragments for each level?</h4>
    1-6: 5x5 25 fragments<br>
    7-11: 5x5 25 fragments<br>
    12-16: 5x10 50 fragments<br>
    17-21: 5x10 50 fragments<br>
    22-31: 5x15 75 fragments<br>
    26-31: 5x15 75 fragments<br>
    32-36: 5x25 125 fragments<br>
    37-41: 5x30 150 fragments<br>
    42-46: 5x35 175 fragments<br>

    57-61: 5x50 250 fragments<br>
    62-66: 5x100 500 fragments<br>
    67-71: 5x200 1000 fragments<br>
    72-75: 4x300 1200 fragments<br>
    Total for one hero to level 75: 4125 fragments<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Dungeon Portal</h2>
    <h4>What</h4>
    This area allows you to use an acquired dungeon scrolls. There are a multitude of scrolls available to use.
    <h4>Why</h4>
    They offer gold, runes (after level 60) and crimson ore if you're lucky enough. This is the primary way you'll be collecting crimson ore to expand your party.
    <h3>Misc</h3>
    <h4>What does the colored difficulty text mean?</h4>
    The colored text indicates the game's prediction of how difficult that dungeon will be for you. There are difficulty indicators in the name of the map but that is hardcoded and doesn't indicate how difficult the dungeon will actually be for you.<br>
    Look at the colored text for a better representation of the subjective difficulty for you and your unique account.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Relic Exchange</h2>
    <h4>What</h4>
    Relic exchange allows you to exchange dust for unique parts that make up a relic. These parts may contain different stats or passive effects.<br>
    <h4>Why</h4>
    The passive effects on relics can dramastically change the dynamic of a team. As well as who you equip it to. This exchange is a great way to maxmize your relic stats.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Treasury/Mining Camp/Logging Camp</h2>
    <h4>What</h4>
    These plots are passive accumulation of materials. With higher levels increasing accumulation speed and increasing their capacity.<br>
    <h4>Why</h4>
    Manually collecting these materials can sometimes be mundane. Upgrading these plots can automate the process.<br>
    <h3>Misc</h3>
    <h4>What's the maximum level for these plots?</h4>
    16
    <h4>The materials required for upgrade are higher than my maximum inventory limit</h4>
    There are two ways you can go over your inventory limit and they are: premium camp and boss chests. Premium camp raises your inventory limit and when the camp ends you can get 150% the material that you collected after the camp was activated, when you watch an ad (or without ad if you have the no ad pack). The other way is to open boss chests. These chests ignore your inventory limits, if you take the x5 offer by watching an ad (you again don't need to watch an ad, if you have the no ad pack), and will allow you to go over it to an infinite amount. The only downside is you may only open 25 chests a day.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Runes</h2>
    <h4>What</h4>
    Runes are items, that you can obtain through dungeons after your account ahs reached the level 60. You can use runes to upgrade some heroes even further.<br>
    <h4>Why</h4>
    With runes you can upgrade currently 10 legendary heroes in another way than just increasing their level. They give the hero, you've used the runes on special abilitys. They can greatly increase a heroes use.<br>
    <h3>Misc</h3>
    <h4>Who should I invest runes in?</h4>
    The main heroes who are worth investing runes in are:<br>
    Jenny - until rune 20<br>
    Vanessa - until rune 10<br>
    Paul - until rune 30<br>
    Evelyn - until rune 30<br>
    Mia - until rune 20<br>
    If you got all of them to the corresponding rune level, try to level all of their runes to 30, because the other heroes runes aren't worth investing in.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Hero Office</h2>
    <h4>What?</h4>
    The hero office is another building in your village, that does two different things:<br>
    1. In the first tab, you can see the reputation of your hero office. The reputation increases, once you hit a certain amount of levels from all your heroes. Only levels from heroes, that aren't special or limited heroes. And they will stop counting for that hero, once you hit level 55 of the hero,<br>
    2. The second tab is a bit more complicated. On level one, you will get 6 gold bars every day. If you log on 2 days in a row, you will get 12 bars on day 2. The maximum amount of bars, you can get is 60, after lgging on 10 days in a row, on the 11th day you will also get 60 bars. That will continue into eternity. With the gold bars, you can level up the second tab of the hero office. You will most likely hear people just say hero office for the second tab. each new level, you will get some permanent buffs, one item, that you will get instanly upon leveling up and one item, that you will be rewarded daily, just like the gold bars.<br>
    <h4>Why?</h4>
    The buffs, you will get from the first tab are really strong and will boost your team a lot and the buffs you will get from the second tab are also really good.<br>
    <h4>Additional tips</h4>
    -You should always level up all your heroes to at least level 55, since until then, they will count towards the level in the first tab of the hero office.<br>
    -You should boost your second tab, with gems, to level five first, so you get the 11th team member, which is a really big improvement to your team.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Random Tips</h2>
    -New rumble passes always start on the 1st of each month at 4pm CET(10am EST). If you have no desire to purchase the pass, hold your weekly and daily task rewards until the rumble pass releases. If timed correctly you'll skip around 7 levels on day one.<br>
    -Keep your inventory of weapons/armor low if possible. There is na inventory limit and you will stop collecting items if you reach it. If you don't see yourself ever having a need for that piece, dismantle it.<br>
    But don't just dismantle any armor piece that's worse than your current one, since you may need it in World Boss or Rift challenge.<br>
